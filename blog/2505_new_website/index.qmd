Since today, I have a new personal website! The site mainly serves as a repository to host some of my research projects and developed course materials. I may also write an occasional blogpost!


Developing the website was really a breeze, thanks to the [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) software and the [materials by Samantha Shanny-Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/talks_workshops/2022-08-05-creating-your-personal-website-using-quarto/){target="_blank"}.
