    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, I was doing some programming for the R software mice, and it turns out I needed to calculate the residual degrees of freedom after performing regression with a ridge penalty to improve numerical stability. Perhaps, I thought, the glmnet package might provide any help, and at least may serve to verify my understanding. Although I love the glmnet package, I should’ve known better. That is, the package is great for estimation, but makes some design choices that are buried somewhere deep in the documentation, which can make it hard to find what is actually going on under the hood. In the end, I found out how glmnet performs ridge regression, so all good, I suppose."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nBy default, glmnet fits a lasso regression model, which is fairly similar but uses an \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty for the coefficients, which results in some coefficients estimated to be precisely zero. Changing the alpha parameter yields a mixture between 1-alpha times the ridge penalty and alpha times the lasso penalty.↩︎"
