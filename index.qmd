## Hi! I'm Thom

I'm doing a PhD on **synthetic data** and **privacy-preserving statistics**, which is just a fancy way of saying I make fake data that looks real. 
Besides, I procrastinate by reading on Bayesian methods, marginally improving my R packages or giving workshops on any these topics.

If you want to **collaborate**, check out my [GithHub](https://github.com/thomvolker) for active projects.
I work, among other things, on [synthetic data](), [differential privacy](), [missing data imputation](), [Bayesian sample size determination]() and [density ratio estimation](https://thomvolker.github.io/densityratio). 
If I don't answer your email, I'm probably riding my bike. Sorry!
